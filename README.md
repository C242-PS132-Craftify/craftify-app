Indonesia faces a significant challenge with waste management, as the country generates 69.7 million tons of waste each year with much of it improperly disposed of. This contributes to pollution both on land and oceans harming the ecosystems and public health. A major issue is the lack of efficient waste segregation and recycling systems  resulting in recyclable materials like plastics, and cardboard piling up. Craftify aims to combat this problem also in alignment with the United Nationâ€™s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by promoting sustainable waste management and creative recycling habits through a fun and educational platform.

Our primary research question was: How can we use technology to encourage children to adopt sustainable waste management practices? Our team is dedicated to creating a tool that makes a meaningful impact on sustainability and empowers children to take small but meaningful actions for the planet while encouraging them to develop creativity.
